The data contains a list of real-life experiences and anecdotes from discussions on various subreddits about how AI is impacting their work. Each anecdote (quote) and its summary are present on consecutive rows in a CSV, along with additional metadata that can be ignored. These anecdotes are relevant to how AI is transforming specific industries.

Identify 2-5 most frequently occurring themes of experiences. Ensure each theme is sufficiently distinct and specific to the industry's experiences with AI. Don't repeat themes. If there are similar anecdotes, group them under one theme and find another.

For each theme:
1. Provide a concise title (5-7 words)
2. Write a brief description (10-20 words)
3. Select 2-5 quotes that best represent the theme

Selection criteria for quotes:
- Describe actual anecdotes or real-life experiences that have happened to someone
- Choose quotes across a diverse set of experiences and industries
- Directly specify how AI is impacting their work
- Avoid speculation, opinions, or hypothetical scenarios

Provide the output in this format:

{theme_rank: <a number between 1-3>}
{theme_title: string}
{theme_description: string}
{quotes:
1. "Quote 1"
2. "Quote 2"
3. "Quote 3"}

Ensure the quotes are verbatim from the data and clearly illustrate the theme.
