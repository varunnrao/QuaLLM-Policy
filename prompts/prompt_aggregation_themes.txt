Analyze the provided list of items, each containing a "title", "description", and "quote". Focus on identifying systemic risks caused by AI that impact <STAKEHOLDER>. A systemic risk is defined as a risk specific to high-impact capabilities of general-purpose AI models, or due to actual or reasonably foreseeable negative effects on public health, safety, public security, fundamental rights, or society as a whole, that can be propagated at scale across the value chain.

Key systemic risks include:
1. Labor market risks
2. Global AI divide
3. Market concentration risks and single points of failure
4. Risks to the environment
5. Risks to privacy
6. Copyright infringement

Follow these steps precisely:

1. Identify Primary Themes:
   - Select primary themes from the key systemic risks list that are directly supported by quotes in the input data.
   - Include only primary themes that have associated secondary themes.

2. Identify Secondary Themes:
   - For each primary theme, identify a few (1-5) secondary themes that are directly supported by quotes.
   - Each secondary theme should:
     a) Be 10-15 words long.
     b) Make a strong, precise argument or point.
     c) Be directly related to its primary theme.
     d) Be supported by at least one specific quote from the input data.
     e) Be unique and not overlap with other secondary themes.

3. Consolidate Overlapping Themes:
   - If you identify overlapping or similar secondary themes, consolidate them into a single, comprehensive secondary theme.
   - Ensure the consolidated theme captures the essence of all overlapping themes.
   - List all relevant quotes from the original overlapping themes under the consolidated theme.

4. Select Supporting Quotes:
   - For each secondary theme, include all relevant quotes that strongly support the theme.
   - Include multiple quotes if they all make the point clearly and add value.
   - Quotes must be at least 10 words long.
   - Include the entire quote without truncation.

5. Ensure Relevance and Non-Redundancy:
   - Include only themes that have direct quote evidence.
   - Do not include themes based on prior knowledge or generalizations.

6. Format Output:
   Present the analysis as a simple list with the following structure:
   1. [Primary Theme]
      a. [Unique Secondary Theme 1]
         Quote: "[Supporting quote 1 for Secondary Theme 1]"
         Quote: "[Supporting quote 2 for Secondary Theme 1]" (if applicable)
      b. [Unique Secondary Theme 2]
         Quote: "[Supporting quote 1 for Secondary Theme 2]"
         Quote: "[Supporting quote 2 for Secondary Theme 2]" (if applicable)
      c. [Unique Secondary Theme 3]
         Quote: "[Supporting quote 1 for Secondary Theme 3]"
         Quote: "[Supporting quote 2 for Secondary Theme 3]" (if applicable)

   2. [Next Primary Theme]
      ...

   - Include only the list structure above. Do not add any additional text, explanations, or conclusions.
   - Include only those primary themes that have associated secondary themes with direct quote evidence.
   - Skip any primary themes that do not have associated secondary themes.

Ensure your output is a concise list that directly addresses systemic risks related to <STAKEHOLDER> based solely on the quotes provided in the input data, with unique and non-overlapping secondary themes.
