Analyze the provided list of anecdotes, each containing a "quote" and "summary".
Categorize each anecdote based on the systemic risks caused by AI that explicitly impact workers.

Key systemic risks and their corresponding category numbers:
1. Labor market risks
2. Global AI divide
3. Market concentration risks and single points of failure
4. Risks to the environment
5. Risks to privacy
6. Copyright infringement
7. Anecdotes unrelated to the impact of AI on work

Follow these steps precisely:

1. Read each anecdote carefully, considering both the quote and the summary.

2. Determine if the anecdote explicitly discusses AI's impact on work:
   - If yes, assign the most appropriate category from 1-6.
   - If no, assign category 7.

3. Format the output as a simple JSON file with the following structure:

{
  "categories": [1, 7, 1, 7]
}

4. Ensure that:
   - Each anecdote is assigned exactly one category number.
   - Categories 1-6 are used ONLY when AI's impact on work is explicitly discussed.
   - Category 7 is used for all other cases, when anecdotes are unrelated to the impact of AI on work
   - The category numbers are listed in the same order as the anecdotes in the input.
   - The number of category assignments matches the number of input anecdotes.

Produce only the JSON output as described above, without any additional explanations or text.
